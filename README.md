The provided examples walk through the build procedure for a reduced order model and its subsequent usage to solve the forward model. This reduced forward model is used in a least squares minimization for parameter estimation to fit the model to the provided data examples.

The examples are set up to solve the following PDE (with variations):
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial t}=\nabla \cdot \left(D(\textbf{x}) \nabla (N)\right)+k_p(\textbf{x})N\left(1-N\right) - \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{2}\alpha_i C(\textbf{x},t)e^{-\beta_i t} \tag{1}$$
